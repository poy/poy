I'm a passionate software engineer with a deep love for Go and a keen interest in emerging technologies. Currently, I'm delving into the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/), exploring its potential to enhance system-level programming. My primary focus is on improving developer productivity, and I'm also exploring the citizen developer space through [AppSheet](https://about.appsheet.com/home/) to understand its broader impact.

- ðŸŒ± **Currently Learning:** Advanced concepts in Zig and the capabilities of AppSheet for empowering citizen developers and as always, dabbling with machine learning
- ðŸ’¬ **Ask Me About:** Go, Zig, Developer Productivity, and No-Code Platforms
